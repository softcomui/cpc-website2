main: "FCCPC, by its mandate, receives and looks into consumer complaints in a bid
  to ensuring speedy redress for complainants. Any person who uses products or services
  expects to get value from them. When this expectation is not met, it gives rise
  to complaints. \n\nIn order for FCCPC to address a complaint, the complainant must
  have initially engaged the provider of services or products. If not satisfied, the
  complainant can then file a complaint with FCCPC. This may either be in hard copy
  and delivered to any of our offices or by soft copy through the website portal or
  email. Please see the tab “About Us” on the home page.\n\nThe complaint must clearly
  state the following:\n1. The party complained against, with the correct address\n2.
  The amount involved\n3. The expected redress \n\nYou should also attach proof of
  transaction and any other documents to support your claim. \n\nAll these will help
  FCCPC with the process of redress, if a valid complaint is established. \n\nIf your
  complaint was received electronically, you should expect an immediate acknowledgement.
  If your complaint was received in hard copy, you should expect to get an acknowledgment
  within 2 working days.\n\nA complaint could be resolved immediately or take much
  more time depending on the nature of the complaint. Complaints require a response
  from the provider of products and services which FCCPC will request for. Some require
  the intervention of other stakeholders such as sector regulators while others do
  not.  While FCCPC is committed to providing speedy redress to valid complaints,
  the provision of accurate information and documentation makes this easier and reduces
  the timelines.\n\nIt takes anything between one (1) day and forty five days (45)
  days to get redress. However, some exceptions may exist beyond this timeframe."
