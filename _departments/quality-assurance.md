main: "The Quality Assurance and Development Department is responsible for assessing
  and monitoring product and service standard quality.  This, being a diverse mandate,
  and considering the Council oversees all products and services, the QAD operates
  both from a life and material sciences standpoint, as well as technical standards.
  \ For the life science operations, QAD manages a Council testing laboratory and
  interfaces with other organizations with testing laboratories for tests the Council
  cannot conduct.  QAD works closely with S & E in its monitoring activities by providing
  the inspections expertise and spot product testing component of surveillance and
  monitoring. \n\nQAD is the Council’s direct and functional interface with other
  regulators, with respect to setting and reviewing prevailing standards.  The department
  engages industry and assists with developing acceptable Operational Manuals and
  Standard Operating Procedures. \n\n\nThe Department continues to explore new ways
  of protecting consumers against hazardous and substandard products. In furtherance
  of this, QAD is leading the effort within the Council in partnering with donor entities
  on nationwide quality projects such as the Nigerian Quality Infrastructure Programme
  (NQIP) of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), including
  nurturing the emerging FCCPC standards and certifications training institution/centre.\n"
