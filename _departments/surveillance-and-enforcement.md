main: "The Surveillance and Enforcement Department (S & E) is a key operational unit
  of the Commission.  The department hosts and manages the complaint resolution functions;
  and the surveillance and enforcement activities of the Commission.  In resolving
  complaints, the department participates in simple resolutions, negotiations, mediations,
  conciliations and investigations. As part of the outcome of complaint resolution,
  beyond modifying behaviour, the department, on behalf of the Commission, secures
  remedies for consumers including compensation, repair, replacement or restitution,
  where applicable.  \n\nThe department’s monitoring activities extend to ensuring
  that providers and producers do not engage in misleading advertisement, and make
  appropriate and sufficient disclosures.  The department is responsible for assessing
  and approving promotions, and evaluating conduct during and after the promotion,
  or when consumers complain. The department leads the Commission’s effort in monitoring
  and reporting market trends, and is responsible for input into key publications
  and orders of the Commission such as, banned products list, product recalls, where
  applicable, and compliance with international and domestic disclosure and warning
  standards and regulations.\n\nSome of the undercover and sting operations of the
  department have resulted in seizure and confiscation of otherwise hazardous or substandard
  goods, and the prevention of same from entering the stream of trade.   The key interface
  between operational departments and other regulators is the Surveillance and Enforcement
  Department.  \n"
