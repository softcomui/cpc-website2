main: "The Surveillance and Enforcement Department is a key operational unit of the
  Council.  The department hosts and manages the complaint resolution function of
  the Council; and the surveillance and enforcement activities of the Council.  In
  resolving complaints, the department participates in simple resolutions, negotiations,
  mediations, conciliations and investigations. As part of the outcome of complaint
  resolution, beyond modifying behaviour, the department, on behalf of the Council,
  secures remedies for consumers including compensation, repair, replacement or restitution,
  where applicable.  \n\nThe department’s monitoring activities extend to ensuring
  that providers and producers do not engage in misleading advertisement, and make
  appropriate and sufficient disclosures.  Sales promotion continue to be a tricky
  area, raising the question of transparency and disclosures.  The department is responsible
  for assessing and approving promotions, and evaluating conduct during and after
  the promotion, or when consumers complain. The department leads the Council’s effort
  in monitoring and reporting market trends, and is responsible for input into key
  publications and orders of the Council such as, banned products list, product recalls,
  where applicable, and compliance with international and domestic disclosure and
  warning standards and regulations.\n\nSome of the undercover and sting operations
  of the department have resulted in seizure and confiscation of otherwise hazardous
  or substandard goods, and prevented others from entering the stream of trade.   The
  key interface between operational departments and other regulators is the Surveillance
  and Enforcement Department.  \n"
