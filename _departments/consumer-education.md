The Consumer Education Department has the critical task of informing and educating consumers about their rights and responsibilities. The department also provides timely and useful information on market developments and related issues.  To best achieve its mandate and expand the Commission’s reach, the department actively engages market executives, Local Government Councils, traditional media organisations, civil society such as Consumer Protection Associations (CPAs), other Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Community Based Organisations (CBOs), as trusted and respected dissemination channels. More recently, and in order to promote efficiency, as well as in recognition of more innovative business strategies to advertise and develop customer loyalty, the department is exploring Business Guidance opportunities to leverage on to educate consumers.

Core functions of this department include:

* Organizing and undertaking campaigns and other activities to increase consumer awareness.
  

* Encourage the formation of voluntary consumer groups or associations for consumer welfare including providing support, such as capacity development, recommendations and matching other partners to such groups. 

* Periodically publishing products whose consumption and sale have been banned, withdrawn, restricted or unapproved by the Federal Government or foreign governments. 

* Development, production and dissemination of consumer education materials, including print, audio, and other electronic materials, in applicable languages.

The department, in collaboration with the Commission’s media team, operates a full-service studio for producing programs for television and other forms of dissemination.  The studio also records and archives activities and events of the Commission for educational and reference purposes.  Some of the programs of the department are regularly aired on television. In addition, the department also coordinates television and radio programs in different languages, for grassroots sensitisation and awareness.

Another initiative of the Commission coordinated by the department, is the publication of a quarterly journal- “The Consumer Voice” which provides periodic updates about matters consumers need to be aware of.
