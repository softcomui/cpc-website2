title: Public Relations (PR) Unit
permalink: "/about/departments/public-relations/"
main: "The Public Relations Unit is the vital conduit between the Commission and the
  public.  Operating from the Office of the Chief Executive Officer, the unit is responsible
  for the entire communications value chain of the Commission, both internal and external.
  \ As the image manager of the Commission, the PR Unit coordinates strategic communication,
  engages in crisis and perception management, where necessary, and manages the Commission’s
  presence on multiple platforms.  The sensitive role and balance this unit plays
  is best underscored by the operations of other departments such as Surveillance
  and Enforcement, and Consumer Education, which use the various communication channels
  and platforms to discharge their responsibilities. \n\nIn addition, maintaining
  and expanding the Commission’s relationship with both traditional and new media
  in a fast moving and dynamic environment, covering multiple sectors and gathering
  information about developments for timely releases or intervention, are some of
  the daily round-the-clock responsibilities of the Public Relations Unit. "
