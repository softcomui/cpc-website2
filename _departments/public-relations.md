main: "The Public Relations Unit is the vital conduit between the Council and the
  public.  Operating from the Office of The Director General, the unit is responsible
  for the entire communications value chain of the Council, both internal and external.
  \ As the image manager of the Council, the PR Unit coordinates strategic communication,
  engages in crisis and perception management, where necessary, and manages the Council’s
  presence on multiple platforms.  The sensitive role and balance this unit plays
  is best underscored by the operations of other departments such as Surveillance
  and Enforcement, and Consumer Education, which use the various communication channels
  and platforms to discharge their responsibilities. \n\nIn addition, maintaining
  and expanding the Council’s relationship with both traditional and new media in
  a fast moving and dynamic environment, covering multiple sectors and gathering information
  about developments for timely releases or intervention, are some of the daily round
  the clock responsibilities of the Public Relations Unit. "
