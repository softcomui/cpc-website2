The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) and the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) have resolved to strengthen partnership on issues of road safety and welfare of consumers.

This was the outcome of a meeting between the Director General of the Council, Babatunde Irukera, and the Corps Marshal of the FRSC, Boboye Oyeyemi, when the Director General paid a courtesy call on the Corps Marshal at the FRSC National Headquarters in Abuja, on Wednesday, January 24, 2018.

According to Irukera, both the FCCPC and FRSC, share some common values on issues of protecting the safety and welfare of consumers through the creation of adequate awareness on the unethical practices of some service providers.

He further stated that the importance of public awareness on issues of qualitative service delivery and the rights of the consumers to complain against poor services cannot be overemphasised, noting that the two organisations must work together in the interest of consumers.

The FCCPC boss said his visit was to explore areas of common interest for greater synergy between the two agencies, adding that the commitment of the FRSC leadership and the staff to issues of quality service delivery is exemplary in public service in the country.

He commended the FRSC for always willing to share its ideas with other stakeholders in common national goals, stating that “what FRSC is doing, is a lesson to others in public service offices”.

On a joint campaign to educate consumers on their rights, the Director General called on FRSC to join hands with the Council for collective efforts against importers and manufacturers of fake tyres, pointing out that, the transportation sector remained a cause for concern. He further stressed the need for measures to be put in place to ensure proper service delivery.

In his own remarks, the FRSC Corps Marshal, while thanking the Director General for the visit, commended him for his recent progressive strides in the interest of consumers’ rights, saying the unrelenting efforts he has been making to create public awareness on consumer rights have made members of the public to become more aware of, and sensitive to issues of quality service delivery.

Oyeyemi further stated that the visit was a renewal of the existing relationship between the two organisations, saying the Council remains one of the strategic stakeholders of FRSC.

As part of the efforts to sustain the relationship, the two leaders resolved to set up a technical committee that would harmonise all areas of mutual interest for greater collaboration in the joint campaigns to protect consumers from the unethical practices of some service providers.

Highlight of the visit was the facility tour undertaken by the Council’s Director General to the FRSC Call Centre and other infrastructural base which support the Commission’s technological innovation for efficient management of traffic in the country.
