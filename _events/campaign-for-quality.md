The Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has said the Lagos State Government is ready to work with the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) to ensure that Nigerian consumers get quality value from products and services they pay for.

Ambode gave the assurance during a visit to the Lagos House in Alausa, Ikeja, by a delegation of the FCCPC, and top officials of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), led by the Director-General of FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera.

He said his administration had set up the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA) to complement the efforts of the Council in protecting Nigerian consumers against unwholesome products and services.

Ambode, noting that consumers deserve better, queried:

“is the kind of service that we provide in terms of transport, the kind of thing that people should have? Should we just label them, and say that is what their lifestyle should be? These are things that we should find some platforms to talk about.”

Earlier, Irukera said the Lagos State economy was not only one of the largest sub-national economies in Africa, but also one of the most recognised sub-national economies in the world.

Irukera, who said the delegation was in the state to kick-off its advocacy on the “National Quality Infrastructure Project,” explained that the choice of Lagos was due to its status as at the country’s commercial hub.

The Director General also paid a courtesy call on the Oba of Lagos, His Royal Majesty, Oba Rilwan Akiolu, to intimate him about the launch of the National Campaign.

As part of the activities to flag off the launch of the campaign, Irukera, in company of UNIDO officials, addressed students of tertiary institutions and youth on the importance of imbibing the quality culture as a way of life. He urged them to always demand and insist on quality.
