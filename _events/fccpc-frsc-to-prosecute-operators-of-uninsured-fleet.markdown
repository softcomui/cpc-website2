The Federal Competition & Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) and the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) have agreed to jointly prosecute transporters whose fleet are not appropriately insured in 2020.

Babatunde Irukera, CEO, FCCPC, announced this recently while addressing participants at a collaborative workshop held by both organisations to engage passengers, fleet operators and other road users at Shehu Musa Yar 'Adua Centre, Abuja.

"Right there at the table, we agreed on a few new regulations. We will make it mandatory for operators to maintain appropriate insurance. We will prosecute those who fail to do that, and I will personally do it by myself", Mr. Irukera stated.

The FCCPC boss said, if any passenger experiences loss, injury or fatality on account of the conduct of a fleet operator and there is no insurance, FCCPC and FRSC will make sure the fleet operator becomes a self insurer and compensates appropriately and adequately. 

Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, the Corps Marshall, FRSC, expressed happiness about the collaboration between FRSC and FCCPC. 

"We started since early in the year, and next year, we are going to come out with a very strong implementation of different phases, especially like what the DG, FCCPC, said on the insurance," Dr. Oyeyemi declared. 

"Agencies need to collaborate. With all these collaborations, the result is improving the services, building the nation, getting things done, doing the right thing and all are under the ease of doing business", the Corps Marshall further stated.
