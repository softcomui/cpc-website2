The Consumer Protection Council (CPC) had a strategic engagement with the media as part of its desire to forge a stronger partnership with the media for a virile consumer protection regime in Nigeria.

Director General of the Council, Babatunde Irukera, considered this engagement as critical to his administration’s priorities, because of the role and place of the media in the crusade for an enhanced consumer protection in Nigeria.

The event, which was held on November 30, 2017 at Protea Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos, had “Partnership for Protection" as its theme, and attracted more than 80 participants, comprising mainly of News Directors, Business Editors, and News Editors.

Irukera underscored the need for sustained media input in the campaign for the protection of rights of Nigerian consumers. He observed that, “the non-protection of citizens against exploitation by organisations or fellow individuals, embitters the people, and that this must be addressed".

He emphasised that, “the change we desire in the media is as regards citizens’ obligations and rights; we need pragmatic collaboration with the media to change the society and make the difference in consumers’ lives. 
“The media has roles to play in the campaign to promote consumer protection and awareness; and should modify business behaviours in favour of the citizens," he added.
