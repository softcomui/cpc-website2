On March 14, 2018, the Ford Motor Company in the United States initiated a recall. Approximately 1.4 million vehicles are affected by the recall. The purpose of the recall is that; on some models, steering wheel bolts could become loose and cause the steering wheel to potentially detach. This could lead to a serious accident. Ford admits that it has become aware of two accidents and one injury that may have been caused by the problem.

This particular recall applies to Ford Fusion and the Lincoln MKZ models from model years 2014-2018. Specifically, every Fusion version; Fusion S, SE, Hybrid S, SE, Hybrid Titanium, Fusion Energi SE, Engergi Titanium, Fusion Sport, Fusion Platinum, Fusion Hybrid Platinum and Fusion Energi Platinum. With respect to Lincoln MKZ, the recall also applies to every version of the Lincoln MKZ, Lincoln MKZ Premier, Hybrid Premier and Black Label.

In addition to the above, but on a separate note, Ford is also recalling another 6,000 Fusion and Ford Focus models due to a risk of fire from a fracture in the clutch pressure plate. The relevant model years are 2013-2016.

Although the recall appears to be limited to North America, the Council is in the process of contacting local Ford dealers to verify the batch, lot of group of individual vehicles involved, and whether any was exported to, and sold in Nigeria. The Council recognizes that some of the versions of the subject models were unlikely to have been manufactured for possible export to Nigeria.

However, considering that some could have been, and proceeding in an abundance of caution for the safety of Nigerian consumers, the Council requests anyone who purchased, owns or currently drives any of these Ford models to immediately contact the Council by sending an e-mail to the Council at contact@cpc.gov.ng. The e-mail should include the specific model, year, and version of the car, the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) which is located on the top left side of the dashboard, and is in view from and through the windscreen of the vehicle. The e-mail should also include the name, telephone number and any other contact information for the owner or driver of the vehicle. The subject of the e-mail should be Ford 2018 Recall.

The Council will provide relevant updates, warning, or advisories, where applicable.
