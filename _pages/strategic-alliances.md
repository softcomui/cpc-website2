  As a matter of operation of law, consumer protection is a vital and joint responsibility on many levels. Because it is a crucial centrepiece of business, and a primary and critical role of government, it is not uncommon that there is dual, or multiple regulation and regulators. This duplication or multiplicity is not a conflict, nor is it unintended. On the contrary, it is an overlap. Regulatory overlap is a deliberate and common design to ensure complete coverage and protection which is paramount in consumer protection.

  As such, by law, several sector regulators also have statutory responsibilities to protect consumers in their sectors. Although the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has overall oversight over protecting consumers across all sectors, the concurrent regulatory jurisdiction and approach in the laws seeks to improve protection outcomes by fostering collaboration.

  To accomplish this, FCCPC promotes and engages in strategic alliances with sector regulators and other parties with whom a partnership can reinforce consumer protection and prevent mistreatment or exploitation of citizens. Apart from the regulatory convergence on consumer protection with other regulators, institutional objectives convergence with the Council’s mandate occurs with civil society and sometimes, development partners. These are important to the Council. Some of these strategic alliances define the Council’s processes or how issues are addressed in different sectors.
