List:
- title: 
  body: The Council in fulfilment of its statutory mandate deploys several regulatory
    tools to monitor and modify behaviour of service providers and manufacturers.
    Some key areas of operation include complaint resolution, surveillance and enforcement,
    consumer education, as well as research and strategy.
- title: Complaint Resolution
  body: Using different mechanisms, the Council resolves complaints that are filed
    with the Council. Usually, consumer grievances and dissatisfaction are filed with
    the Council as “Complaints”. The Council receives these complaints in diverse
    ways including online, in-person, in writing, and multiple social media platforms.
    Most complaints are resolved using one or more of our resolution tools, such as
    direct engagement, negotiations, mediation, conciliation, investigations, administrative
    hearings and collaboration with other regulators. Investigations and hearings
    usually occur when a market intervention becomes compelling, or conduct is egregious
    or indicative of a pattern or widespread infraction.
- title: Surveillance & Enforcement
  body: A vital tool of protecting consumers is market surveillance, and enforcement
    where violations occur. This component of our work is both random and targeted.
    Most targeted interventions are on account of intelligence gathered by, or provided
    to the Council, including anonymous tips. Random interventions are a quality assurance
    mechanism. Some activities here are preventive and may lead to publishing Guidelines
    or Advisories about products in the market and restrictions on consumption or
    use.
- title: Quality Assurance & Development
  body: The satisfaction and safety of the Nigerian consumer are paramount. The Council
    is commit to nationwide quality assessment of products and services, through inputs
    into national & international standards, sampling, analysis, investigation, process
    auditing, developing and issuance of guidelines/standard operating procedures
    (SOPs) in order to ensure that products, services and processes are of good quality,
    safe and meet consumers’ expectation, while giving value for money.
- title: Consumer Education
  body: A fundamental factor in consumer protection is an educated consumer. As such,
    the Council engages in routine and periodic consumer education to inform consumers
    of their rights, available enforcement mechanisms and how to use the processes.
    Another vital aspect of consumer education is to provide information about key
    market developments such as Advisories, Warnings, recalls and similar interventions.
    The Council conducts numerous specific and general awareness campaigns.
- title: Research & Strategy
  body: |-
    The Council engages in domestic and global research about products and services, as well as changing or evolving market trends and consumer behaviour. The objectives are to:

    * provide data base for organisational planning purposes on the concept of consumerism;

    * develop strategies for interventions; and

    * modify existing mechanisms to be more effective and/or efficient.

    Research and strategy play a pivotal role in how the Council accomplishes its mandate and allocates its limited resources.
