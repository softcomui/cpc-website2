    Act no 66 of 1992 (now CPC Act Cap C25, LFN 2004) and commenced operations in
    1999. CPC is an agency under the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment

    services. CPC defers to the sector specific regulators for resolution where appropriate.

  body: "Any person who uses products or services expects to get value from them.
    When this expectation is not met, it gives rise to complaints.\n\nIn order for
    CPC to address a complaint, the complainant must have initially engaged the provider
    of services or products. If not satisfied, the complainant can then file a complaint
    with CPC. This may either be in hard copy and delivered to any of our offices
    or by soft copy through the website portal or email. Please see the tab “About
    Us” on the home page.\n\nYou can also give CPC tips on practices against the welfare
    of consumers. This can be done through our hotlines 08056002020 and 08056003030.\n\nThe
    complaint must clearly state the following:\n1. The party complained against,
    with the correct address\n2. The amount involved\n3. The expected redress \n\nYou
    should also attach proof of transaction and any other document to support your
    claim. \n\nAll these will help CPC with the process of redress, if a valid complaint
    is established. "
- title: What is the time frame within which a complaint must be made after a breach
    of a right?

    to CPC as soon as possible, after the right has been breached, especially within
    the warranty period.

    of products and services which CPC will request for. Some require the intervention
    of other stakeholders such as sector regulators while others do not.  While CPC
    is committed to providing speedy redress to valid complaints, the provision of
    accurate information and documentation makes this easier and reduces the timelines.
