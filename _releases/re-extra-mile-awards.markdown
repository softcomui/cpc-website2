The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) welcomes the Extra Mile Awards conferred on it by the Federal Government of Nigeria in recognition and commendation for the Commission’s “Outstanding Performance” during the COVID-19 pandemic and its participation in the Sustainable Production/Delivery of Essential Commodities Committee of the Federal Government.


While expressing its gratitude for the recognition and award, the Commission realizes and notes that protecting consumers and citizens remains an emergent and urgent calling upon all, including all arms of government, civil society, industry and all other stakeholders.


The Commission will continue to intensify its efforts and invites, as well as encourages all, to collaborate as we not only build consensus on the priority of consumer rights protection, but also demand and insist these rights are respected and protected.
