The Federal Competition & Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) is the agency of the Federal Government, established under the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act, 2018 for the overall and multi-sector regulation of competition and consumer protection in Nigeria.

A key mandate of the agency is consumer education.  In discharging its mandate, the law stipulates that the Commission should engage in advocacy to increase consumer awareness; ensure consumers interests receive appropriate attention, encourage trade, industry and professional associations to develop and enforce quality standards; as well as to ensure a level-playing field for businesses.



Learning For Life is an initiative that is targeted at young people in secondary schools.  The programme has led to the formation of consumer clubs in schools.  The purpose of the clubs is to promote interest in consumer issues such as quality and consumer rights. It is also to stimulate not only a culture of quality and insistence on consumer rights, but to advocate for same.  


Learning For Life is designed to stimulate a knowledge sharing contest, known as the National Young Consumer Contest, on topical consumer issues and to improve young peopleâ€™s consciousness and understanding of consumer rights, including enforcement mechanisms.
