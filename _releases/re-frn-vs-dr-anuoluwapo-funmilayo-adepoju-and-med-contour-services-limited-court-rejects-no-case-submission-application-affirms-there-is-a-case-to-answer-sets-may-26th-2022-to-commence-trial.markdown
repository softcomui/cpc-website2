Upon adoption and argument of the parties respective briefs and positions, the Court reserved the case for a Decision and Ruling.


Today, April 7, 2022 and seating in Lagos, the Federal High Court entered its decision and ruled rejecting the Defendant’s No Case Submission. Specifically, the Court ruled that the evidence so far propounded, presented and articulated by the Prosecution, and admitted by the Court satisfy the elements of the criminal charges pending against Anuoluwapo Adepoju As such, a prima facie case had been established which requires appropriate defense.


The Court adjourned the case to May 26th for continuation of trial.


Although this judicial process has experienced significant delays, during which allegations and or evidence of isolated or continuing violations of extant regulatory decisions or judicial conditions have arisen, the Commission remains committed to ensuring compliance to the fullest extent of the law.  



As the Court has now returned to seating in, and adjudicating this case, relevant applications seeking appropriate judicial orders to ensure or compel compliance with applicable regulatory interventions or release conditions by the Court will proceed from the Commission.


The Commission welcomes any information or evidence of any activities or actions that can assist in ensuring obedience of the law in this regard, or retribution for disobedience.
