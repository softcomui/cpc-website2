The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission congratulates Airpeace on another major milestone on its journey to becoming a major carrier of choice in Nigeria by acquiring a Boeing 777.

The Boeing 777 is a tested and tried equipment with a legendary reputation for comfort and versatility, as well as a remarkable record of safety. It is indeed one of the most successful long haul and wide bodied aircraft in the skies today.

That Airpeace has acquired one of this world class aircraft, and has grown both its fleet and routes in an almost meteoric manner is testament to the possibilities in the Nigerian market, and the abiding custom of our consumers. 

While welcoming this historic Development, the Council again encourages Airpeace to renew and redouble its commitment to the best possible service and deference to consumers. Therein only lies the key to unlocking further, and enduring growth. Nigerian consumers are as sophisticated, as they are loyal. They deserve the best full attention and care in exchange for their patronage, and reward for their loyalty.

The aviation industry remains one of the most vital catalysts for economic growth and shared prosperity. Reinforcing confidence in safety and institutionalizing innovative products and respectful customer service are the fundamentals industry expansion and perpetuation.

The Council recognizes that fleet renewal is key to accomplishing these objectives and commends the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority for the dynamism that has resulted in this landmark in our aviation development. Maintaining FAA CAT-1, highest level of IOSA certification for both our regulatory processes and domestic airlines are significant factors for safety, security and consumer satisfaction. We urge the NCAA to ensure these.
