The Consumer Protection Council (CPC) had a strategic engagement with the media as part of its desire to forge a workable partnership with the media for a virile consumer protection regime in Nigeria.

Director General of the Council, Babatunde Irukera, considered this engagement as critical in his administration’s priorities because of the role and place of the media in the crusade for an enhanced consumer protection in Nigeria.

The event, which was held on November 30, 2017 at the Protea Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos, attracted more than 80 participants, comprising mainly News Directors, Business Editors and News Editors and had “Partnership for Protection’’ as its theme.

Irukera at the event underscored the need for sustained media input in the campaign on the rights of Nigerian consumers. He observed that “the non-protection of citizens against exploitation by organisations or fellow individuals embitters the people and this must be addressed."

He emphasised that “the change we desire in the media is as regards citizens’ obligations and rights; we need pragmatic collaboration with the media to change the society and make the difference in consumers’ lives.

“The media have roles to play in the campaign to promote consumer protection and awareness; they should modify business behaviours in favour of the citizens," he added.
